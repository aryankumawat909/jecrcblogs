Concept - Jecrc Blogs: This is an application where Jecrc University students can add their blogs, events, galleries, social post, news and more. In this application users can create their accounts, verified users can add guest posts, add comments on blogs and read hundreds of blogs that are related to Jecrc University. This app will help students to be up-to-date. They will not miss anything that is happening at the University. We tried to keep it simple, features rich and easy to scale when required.

Design & UI - We used a theme but first we customized it in figma to make some changes according to our customization. Mahesh was working on the design part. He designed the wireframe in figma then it is handovered to the frontend developing team. 


Front End - Our team member Vaibhav & Yash Jain worked on the front end part of this application. We are using a template, customized it according to our needs. HTML, CSS & Javascript are changed to fill our requirements.


Backend - In backend we are we are using Wordpress and we customized existing php code for some changes. (WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system).

We tried to host this site on github, but it didnâ€™t fullfill our requirements, because it will save the static pages of your project, so if a new user tries to register, or wants to write any new blog he/she will not be able to do it. Thus we deployed it on Linux server

You can view our Github repository here - https://github.com/aryankumawat909/jecrcblogs

And this application is live on - http://jecrc.live/

Migration to server:

- We developed it first on local host using MAMP Server.
- From HtDocs of MAMP & phpMyAdmin(An administrator's tool of sorts, phpMyAdmin is a PHP script meant for giving users the ability to interact with their MySQL databases)

We hosted our files on a Linux server. Configured it according to our requirements and added all required files - Database backup, Theme files to the server.
